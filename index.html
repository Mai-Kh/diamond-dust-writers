<p>We are Diamond Dust Writers. Our name pays homage to a sparkling coffee shop in Northeast Minneapolis. Weâ€™re a bit dusty, not afraid of the grimy work that comes with writing. We're ready to dig in. Like the gem, we grew by accretion. We exert a gentle pressure. We light new fires. We shine.</p>

<p>DDW readings are momentous occasions where we mark the completion of a new chapbook. </p>

<p>A DDW reading is a celebration of work, of assembling each chapbook by hand with the help of family, friends, and community.</p>

<p>Our readings are interactive. We close with an open-mic, an invitation to share a piece of your own or read something that moves you.</p>

<p>We meet at Diamond's Coffee Shoppe in Northeast Minneapolis to read, laugh, clap, and (of course) sell chapbooks.</p>

<p>We gather as readers, writers, makers, and audience-- as all facets of the vibrant Northeast Minneapolis Arts Community.</p>
