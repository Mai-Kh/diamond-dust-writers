<p>Our group’s name, Diamond Dust Writers, pays homage to our gathering place, a sparkling coffee shop in Northeast Minneapolis called Diamonds. We’re a bit dusty, not afraid of the grimy work involved with writing. Ready to dig in. Like the gem, we grew by accretion. We continue to exert kind and gentle pressure. To light fires under each other. To shine.</p>

<h1>Readings</h1>
<p>DDW events are momentous for the group because readings signal the completion of a chapbook and the celebration of that work. The group has created by hand with the expertise and help from our community to design, buy material for, print, and assemble artful chapbooks that showcase writing from each group member. We spread the word about readings via postcards in coffee shop, Facebook posts, email and word of mouth. Our friends and family are devoted to showing up to support us. We owe them a world of gratitude.
  
We design readings to be interactive. Each one has had an open mic segment. We've gathered books to have on hand, so if people didn't bring work to read (their own or someone else's), they can leaf through a book and read something that moves them that evening. All readings have taken place at Diamonds, home to Diamond Dust Writers. Family members help set up, sell chapbooks, clap, laugh, take photos and video, and make other audience members comfortable. We're hopeful attendees see this as we do: a gathering of community, a celebration of readers and writers, creators and audience—all essential aspects to creating art.</p>
