<p>Our group’s name, Diamond Dust Writers, pays homage to our gathering place, a sparkling coffee shop in Northeast Minneapolis called Diamonds. We’re a bit dusty, not afraid of the grimy work involved with writing. Ready to dig in. Like the gem, we grew by accretion. We continue to exert kind and gentle pressure. To light fires under each other. To shine.</p>

<h1>Readings</h1>
<p>DDW readings are momentous occasions for our group where we mark the completion of a new chapbook. A DDW reading is a celebration of work, of assembling each chapbook by hand with the help of family, friends, and community.</p>

<p>Our readings are interactive. We close with an open-mic, an invitation to share a piece of your own or read something that moves you.</p>

<p>We meet at Diamond's Coffee Shoppe in Northeast Minneapolis to read, laugh, clap, and (of course) sell chapbooks. We gather as readers, writers, makers, and audience-- all facets of the vibrant Northeast Minneapolis Arts Community.</p>
