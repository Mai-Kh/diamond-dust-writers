Before I began coding this project, my client, the Diamond Dust Writers (DDW) and I developed our project plan. We discussed why they were interested in a website and what features were needed. We also discussed the audience that would visit the site. Having completed the draft of the static site, I can say that the product is far from meeting all of the goals we identified in our project plan.

This is not because the site is incomplete (if a website can ever really be complete), but because my client and I decided that an iterative approach would be more practical than assuming that our project plan captured every need. Since my client has never had a website before, there are certain to be "things we can't live without that we never knew we needed". The result of an iterative approach would be a site that could more easily evolve with the project plan. The current static site is, therefore, a baseline that meets all of my clients needs; the design is intended to be basic, but flexible.
